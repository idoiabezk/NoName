In other words, the command is the code that is written to perform various tasks.\nFunction: A function is a block of organized, reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Functions in R are used to encapsulate a set of operations or calculations that can be applied to input data, producing an output. They can be built-in functions provided by R or user-defined functions created by the programmer.\nArgument: An argument is a value passed to a function to customize its behavior or provide input data. Functions in R can have zero or more arguments, which are specified within parentheses when the function is called. Arguments can be variables, constants, or expressions, and they influence the outcome of the function’s execution.\nScript: the script refers to a file containing a series of R commands and functions written in the R programming language. Scripts are used to organize and execute multiple commands sequentially to achieve specific tasks, such as data analysis, visualization, or modeling.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 R studio elements\n\nConsole: the console is the interactive environment where users can directly enter and execute R commands. It provides immediate feedback, displaying the output of commands, errors, warnings, and messages generated during code execution. It is important to remark that the data displayed in the console is not saved.\nScript Editor: The script editor is where you write, edit, and save R scripts. Scripts contain a series of R commands and functions organized to perform specific tasks.\nEnvironment Pane: this pane displays information about the current R environment, including data objects, functions, and variables that are currently loaded into memory.\nFile Pane: the file pane allows you to navigate your file system, view files, and manage your R projects. You can also create new files, folders, and scripts from this pane.\nPlots Pane: when you create visualizations or plots in R, they are displayed in the plots pane. This pane allows you to view and interact with your plots.\nPackages Pane: R packages are collections of functions, data sets, and documentation that extend the capabilities of R. The packages pane allows you to manage and install packages from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) and other sources.\nHelp Pane: this pane provides access to R documentation and help files. You can search for functions, packages, and topics to find relevant documentation and examples.\nViewer Pane: the viewer pane displays web-based content generated by R packages or Shiny applications.\nGit Pane: if you are using version control with Git, the Git pane allows you to manage your Git repositories, commit changes, and view version history.\nToolbar: the toolbar provides quick access to commonly used actions and commands, such as saving files, running code, and debugging."

    "text": "2.2 Basic operating\n\n2.2.1 Ins and outs\nIn Rstudio there are two ways of running a command, in other words telling the system to do a task: we can press “ctrl” “Enter”, or we can click on the “Run” icon in the tool bar. We can also cancel a command by pressing “ctrl” “c”.\nRstudio will take everything that we write in the Script Editor or console as a command, and if we want to add a comment in our command we should write “#” before, R will understand that what comes after is not a command. When we command something in the console, the results appear with a number in brackets, for example:\n\n1+1 #Here we are asking R to calculate the sum of 1 and 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nAs can be seen in the example above, when we command “1+1” we get the result is “2”. However, there is “[1]” before it. The number in brackets enumerates the values from the results, in this case, “2” is the first value from our results. This example also shows that the hashtag allows us to include comments in our script which will help to understand it better.\nRStudio works best with vectorized data. A vector is a basic data structure that represents an ordered collection of elements of the same data type, and it can for example be a one-dimension set of numbers, such as the one bellow:\n\n1:6\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\nIn this example, we have used the operator “:” which gives as a result a group of numbers between 1 and 6. This group of number is what we call a vector.\nIf we would like to reuse this vector, then we would need to first save them. For this, Rstudio allows us to generate an object. In the context of RStudio, an object refers to a data structure that holds a value or values. We need to be careful when naming objects, if they start with a number or a special symbol Rstudio will not be able to run it. Also, we need to keep in mind that Rstudio is affected by the capital letters and “House” and “house” are two different things for R. Moreover, we can’t forget that R overwrites the object names, we can always which names have been already assigned by running 1s()\nFollowing up with the previous example we can create an object for the vector, so later on, we will be able to use it in other operations.\n\na &lt;- 1:6 #we generate the object named \"a\" and it will contain the result of the operation \"1:6\"\n\nNow we will have an object named “a” in our environment which contains the vector (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and if we want to operate with it we just need to write the name of the object (a) in our command, such as:\n\na+2\n\n[1] 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\nAs it can be seen in the example, when we sum 2 to the vector named “a”, R does element-wise execution, in other words, it sums 2 to every element in our vector, in this example: (1+2, 2+2, 3+2, 4+2, 5+2, 6+2). R will also element-wise execution when operating with two vectors, and if these do not have the same lengths, R will repeat the short one as long as the long one, this is known as vector recycling.\nHowever, if we would like to do a traditional matrix operation, we should include “%” before and after our operation, for example:\n\na%*%a\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]   91\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Functions\nA function is the task that we ask R to realize, it contains the operations or calculations that can be applied to input data. Some of examples of functions can be the ones bellow:\n\nRound() it is used to round numerical values to a specified number of decimal places, for example:\n\n\nround(2,1)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nmean() it is used to calculate the arithmetic mean (average) of a numeric vector or values, for example:\n\n\nmean(a)\n\n[1] 3.5\n\n\n\nsum() it is used to calculate the sum of numeric values in a vector or a data frame, for example:\n\n\nsum(a)\n\n[1] 21\n\n\n\nsample() it is used to generate random samples from a specified set of elements, for example:\n\n\nsample(a)\n\n[1] 1 6 3 5 2 4\n\n\n\nc() it is used to combine values into a single vector or list, for example:\n\n\nc(1, 5, 12, 20)\n\n[1]  1  5 12 20\n\n\nThere are many functions that we can use in Rstudio, and all of them are composed by three main parts: a name, a body of the code and a set of arguments."
